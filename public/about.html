<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Originally from Atlanta, GA, I landed in Los Angeles in Spring 2019 to begin a career in Visual Effects. 
  After several years of working on box offices hits (as well as some stinkers) I've decided to pivot to a new field of business.</p>

<p>The number 1 thing you should know about me is that I'm a dog mom. 
  My pride and joy is a 14 y/o cranky chihuahua lady named Sammie. We've gone on many adventures together, including a couple trips to Mexico. 
  My other interests include climbing and arts and crafts.</p>
